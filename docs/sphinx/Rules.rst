Card Types

There are two types of cards:

   - Deadline (number of turns before task "burns")
   - Required time (hours needed to complete)
   
   If completed on time - player gains points; if overdue - loses points.

2. **Effect Cards** - Provide bonuses/debuffs (e.g., extra time in a day)

Game Mechanics
--------------
- **Clock** shows available time for the current turn
- **Points** - player's score. Game ends when a player reaches certain points or loses all

Turn Structure
--------------
1. **Turn Start**: Player draws new cards
2. **Card Play**: Play task or effect cards on yourself (to complete tasks) or opponent (to overload them)
3. **Time Allocation**: Distribute available time among active tasks
4. **Turn End**: Pass turn to opponent or end day (score calculation and new day begins)
